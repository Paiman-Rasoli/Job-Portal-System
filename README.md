# Job Portal System with Ruby On Rails (REST APIs)

## Overview

This project is focused in develop a Backend REST API application using Ruby on Rails and MySQL.
It consists of rest api end points for user management, profile management (Job Seeker/Employee),
and posting and looking up jobs. I try use latest version of Ruby on Rails and use best practice and
techniques for developing this backend application.
